# WELCOME TO FLATWARMING

This is an app to centralize all your flat admin needs into one place - so you never forget to put the rubbish out, pay your bills, or forget your flat jobs again!

# GETTING STARTED
* run npm i to install dependencies 
* Reset the database and re-run seeds by running npm run db:reset
* Run the server by running npm run dev
* visit http://localhost:3000 to view!
* When it comes to picking your suburb, please select 'mt eden' or 'epsom' - I had to manually input the suburbs and only had time to put a couple in oops. If you pick a suburb that doesn't exist the app with fail.
